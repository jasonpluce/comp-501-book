Hi there! I'm Nicholas M. Synovic; a current Ph.D. student at Loyola
University Chicago's (LUC) Computer Science department. I'm actively
researching software engineering for science --- particularly at the
intersection of software engineering for science practices and
pre-trained deep learning model reuse --- but have broader interests in
software engineering at large.

   Thank you for your patience.

This website contains professional artifacts and writings. It also
attempts to centralize my online activity for observability and rapid
navigation. This website contains my latest:
